### Focus

New state-specific requirements have emerged for the 2020 redistricting cycle that require additional examination before real-world application. In particular, in 2018 Colorado voters approved Amendment Y to add new language to the state constitution that requires the consideration of political competitiveness in the redrawing of Congressional district maps.  

The goal of the following case study is to define and implement a measure of political competitiveness relevant for Colorado’s redistricting context. Part of this exercise will require  engagement with political redistricting and voting behavior literatures, and to wrestle with differing views on how to quantify political competitiveness. The use of GerryChain allows us to generate an ensemble of potential maps that are constrainted by the state's unique redistricting criteria and political geography.

### State Context

Colorado’s requirements for the redistricting of Congressional districts is established in state constitutional provisions that outline the composition of the Colorado's Independent Congressional Redistricting Commission and the requirements for the redrawing of district boundaries. There are six core requirements for a proposed redistricting plan, organized along a hierarchy of priority:

The application of political competitiveness is especially challenging under this hierarchical criteria structure. That is, not every criterion is treated the same. In fact, the most important level of the criteria outlines proposed maps must include equal population, compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and for all districts to be contiguous. After this first level of criteria is achieved, then maps should preserve whole communities of interest, preserve whole political subdivisions (e.g., county and/or town boundaries), and to keep districts compact. Only after these previous six requirements are satisfied does the redistricting commission consider political competitiveness.

### Political Competitiveness

Political competitiveness can be examined through two distinct bodies of work. Since the inclusion of the political competitiveness language will be relevant for the 2020 redistricting cycle, several papers from mathematicians have recently been published exploring this question in the multiple state contexts. Additionally, political scientists have theorized and tested their own measures of political competitiveness, broadly in relation to voter behavior and partisan politics in single member districts. However, despite this rich research literature, there is no prevailing agreed upon standard on how to best quantify measures of political competitiveness.

### Case Study Findings

There are two significant challenges inherent to this Colorado case study. First is Colorado's hierarchical criteria structure, which requires the balanace of multiple conditions before attending to political competitiveness. Second is the ambiguity of the concept of political competitiveness itself. Therefore, our case study will specifically describe the decision-making trade-offs on how to draw maps that maximize the number of political competitive districts.
