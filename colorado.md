### Focus

During the 2020 redistricting cycle, new state-specific requirements have emerged that require additional examination before real-world implementation. In particular, in 2018 Colorado voters approved Amendment Y to add new language to their state constitution that requires new consideration of political competitiveness in the redrawing of Congressional district maps.  

The goal of the following case study is to define and implement a measure of political competitiveness relevant for Colorado’s redistricting context. Part of this exercise will require  engagement with political redistricting and voting behavior literatures, and to wrestle with the differing ways to view political competitiveness. The use of GerryChain allows us to generate an ensemble of potential maps that are constrainted by the state's unique redistricting criteria and political geography.

### State Context

Colorado’s requirements for the redistricting of Congressional districts is established in Constitutional Provisions that outline the composition of the Colorado Independent Congressional Redistricting Commission and the requirements for the redrawing of district boundaries. There are six core requirements for a proposed redistricting plan, organized along a hierarchy of priority:

The implementation of political competitiveness is especially challenging when considering that Colorado’s redistricting commission adopts a hierarchy of criteria. That is, not every criteria requirement is treated the same. In fact, the most important level of the criteria outlines equal population, compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and for proposed districts to be contiguous. After this first level of criteria is achieved, then maps should preserve whole communities of interest, preserve whole political subdivisions (e.g., county and/or town boundaries), and to keep districts compact. Only after these previous six requirements are satisfied does the redistricting commission consider political competitiveness.
