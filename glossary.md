**Compactness**

**Contiguity**

**Gerrymandering** - the intentional manipulation of electoral district boundaries for personal or partisan gain. Though it is most often talked about in terms of partisan outcomes, racial gerrymandering is employed to dilute or suppress the voices of certain demographic groups either by clustering those groups together ('packing') to limit the number of seats they can get or by separating them into many districts ('cracking') to dilute their votes.

**Markov Chain Monte Carlo**

**Neutral Map**

**Population Balance** - most commonly accepted rul requiring disricts to be relatively equal in population to adhere to the 'one person, one vote' principle

**Redistricting** - the process of reapportioning congressional seats to ensure proportional distirbution across states due to population shifts. Using U.S. census data collected every 10 years, all 50 states must redraw the geographic boundaries of their congressional districts. The rules regulating this process can differ on a state by state basis, although there are common federal rules (e.g. the Voting Rights Act) that govern the process. Additionally, each state decides who controls the process - some states elect to have their state legislatures draw new district boundaries themselves, whereas other states refer the process to a committee of their choosing. Since district boundaries have so much power to shape the dynamics of political representation and influence the outcomes of future elections, this is always a contentious and politically charged process, which creates incentives for gerrymandering.
