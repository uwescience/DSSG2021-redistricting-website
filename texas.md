## Focus

## State Context
Texas has experienced an estimated 15.3% population growth over the last decade from 2010 to 2020, resulting in two additional congressional seats being allocated to Texas in the upcoming redistricting process. Although there has been substantial growth, the population shifts are not uniform across the state. 75% of the state population resides in the “Texas Triangle,” which is composed of the Dallas, Houston, and Austin metro areas, and these regions have experienced the greatest growth.  Conversely, more rural areas have experienced population losses over the past decade, and in fact, 104 of 254 counties in Texas have seen a decline in population.

One of the key drivers in the statewide population growth is gains in minority populations, particularly growth in the Hispanic population. In the new redistricting cycle, it is crucial to consider what a fair map looks like for Black and Latino voters.
