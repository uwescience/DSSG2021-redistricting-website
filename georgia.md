### State Context
In general, we probe some of the built-in metrics of GerryChain in the case of Georgia to propose a standard which identifies some of the techniques of gerrymandering. The state of Georgia has a history of single-party control, in which case, both Legislature and Governorship are controlled by one party, leading to a higher probability of partisan and racial gerrymandering. Given this history, the redistricting process of Georgia should be closely monitored to ensure more competitive voting. Georgia has not received the kinds of state-level judicial relief concerning redistricting that has occurred in other states due to the ambiguity of the stateâ€™s constitution on voting rights and electoral districts. Accordingly, we use this case study with GerryChain to model ways for future users to be involved in the redistricting process of a state of interest with similar challenges.
