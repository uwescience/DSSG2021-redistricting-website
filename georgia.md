### Focus

In this case study, we’re going to focus on partisan considerations, as one of the many guidelines of the redistricting rules in Georgia; which also requires that state legislative districts be contiguous and the compactness of redistricting maps. Furthermore, the proposed map should also consider compactness and political subdivisions. Since state rules aim to achieve a total population that is substantially equal per district, the outcome of the election data in terms of the political parties involved is critical. The state of Georgia is composed of 14 districts with 58% under the control of the republican party, which raises questions concerning fair voting and voting statistics. The focus metric of this study is the "wasted votes" assessment on both the Republican and Democratic parties of the state to evaluate partisan outcomes.

### State Context
As we probe one of the built-in metrics of GerryChain, we introduce a standard which identifies some of the techniques of gerrymandering. Given that the state of Georgia has a history of single-party control, leads to a higher probability of partisan and racial gerrymandering. The redistricting process of Georgia should be closely monitored to ensure more competitive voting. Georgia has not received the kinds of state-level judicial relief concerning redistricting that has occurred in other states due to the ambiguity of the state’s constitution on voting rights and electoral districts. Accordingly, we use this case study with GerryChain to model ways for future users to be involved in the redistricting process of a state of interest facing similar challenges.

### Wasted Votes

Wasted votes by definition; are any votes cast for either party in excess to the 50% needed to win. The first step of our analysis involves generating an ensemble of proposed plans through GerryChain. Then, we measure the “wasted votes” count per district, per party, for each plan within the ensemble. Afterwards, we take the total “wasted votes” count along the ensemble to generate the percentages of “wasted votes” for either party. As such, we ultimately compare “wasted votes percentages with the 2011 enacted plan of Georgia using the 2016 presidential election data.
