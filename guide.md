**Deliverables**

The primary output of our project is a guide entitled "Applying GerryChain: A User's Guide for Redistricting Problems." This document, along with companion code for state-level case studies on Georgia, Colorado, and Texas, is intended to empower citizen groups, non-partisan redistricting commisions, activists, and others use GerryChain to engage in their state or local redistricting process. Though the use of GerryChain poses some technical barriers, for instance a familiarity with the Python coding language is necessary for its effective use, we sought to minimize other barriers by providing a comprehensive guide that answers many common questions and provides enough instructions and context to help users more easily apply GerryChain to their state's redistricting process. This output is motivated by a commitment to the underlying principle of fairness in the redistricting process, which we define as maximizing inclusion and transparency by democratizing the resources, computational tools, and knowledge necessary for citizens to effectively participate in this process.


**Outcomes**

The release of this user's guide intentionally coincides with the 2020 redistricting cycle. Most states will begin the majority of their redistricting work once the 2020 Census data is release on August 12, 2021. This guide is, therefore, a timely addition to the redistricting process. Though it is too early to tell how many people will use the guide in this cycle, the design and focus were informed by our meetings with several stakeholders already operating in the sphere of congressional redistricting. Given the technical complexity of this problem, and the fact that this is the first redistricting cylce in which computational tools like GerryChain are widely avaialble, we are confident that there is both a need for resources like this guide that can help new users apply GerryChain to redistricting problems more effectively.
