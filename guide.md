**Deliverables**

The primary output of our project is a guide entitled "Applying GerryChain: A User's Guide for Redistricting Problems." This document, along with companion code for three state-level case studies on Georgia, Colorado, and Texas is intended to help empower citizen groups, non-partisan redistricting commisions, activists, and others use GerryChain to engage in their state or local redistricting process. Though the use of GerryChain poses some technical barriers, for instance a familiarity with Python is necessary for its effective use, we sought to minimize other barriers by providing a comprehensive guide that could answer many common questions and provide enough instructions and context to help users more easily apply GerryChain to their state's redistricting process. This output is motivated by a commitment to the underlying principle of fairness in the redistricting process, which we define as maximizing inclusion and transparency by democratizing the resources, computational tools, and knowledge necessary for citizens to effectively engage in this process.


**Outcomes**

The release of this user's guide intentionally coincides with the beginning of the current decennial redistricting cycle in most states. Our hope is that this a timely addition to the redistricting process and in the hands of users in time for them to engage in this process. The 2020 Census data was only just released on August 12, 2021; thus, it is too soon to tell how impactful it will be and how many users will consult this guide. However, the design and focus of the guide were informed by our meetings with several stakeholders already operating in the sphere of congressional redistricting. Since this is the first redistricting cylce in which computational tools like GerryChain are widely avaialble, we are confident that there is both a need and an appetite for resources like this guide that can help users apply computational redistricting tools more effectively.
