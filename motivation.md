**Questions** 

How can we access computational tools to help skateholders draw unbiased maps that conform to the specific context of a state?

How can we assit stakeholders in map drawing and evaluating the fairness of proposed plans?

**Needs**

Truly "neutral" maps that are fair, representative, and unbiased has been a difficul goal. Computational methods have expanded greatly since the 2010 redistricting cycle, and the 2020 redistricting cycle promises to be the first time that computational tools are widely available for researchers, redistricting commission members, state legislators, advocacy groups, and community members. There is pronounced interest for computational tools to enter this space and for the tools to meaningfully shape the redistricting process in the coming year. However, computational redistricting is not a solved problem. This work lies at the intersection of multiple fields – mathematics, political science, public policy, human geography, history, legal studies – and requires expansive and in-depth study to advance towards generally agreed upon processes and applications. Our project aims to contribute to redistricting work by evaluating a core set of computational tools and outlying detailed protocols that can speak broadly.

**Background**

Several states passed crucial reforms to the redistricting process in 2018 in an effort to curb gerrymandering practices. These reforms have expanded the legislative framework that state legislators and independent election commissioners must adhere to while creating new districting plans. An analysis method is required to ensure that the proposed plans are aligned with these legislative reforms. More broadly, objective analysis is needed to ensure proposed plans uphold principles of fairness and democratic representation. Recent computational and statistical advances provide tools to help map drawers evaluate potential tradeoffs between redistricting criteria in the map generation process. Additionally, once a plan is proposed, relevant metrics can be used to assess the fairness of plans.

Gerrymandering has been a persistent problem in the US since 1812, but new developments in computation have provided a novel set of tools for addressing this issue. Academic groups at Princeton, Duke, and Tufts have been working in this space for the past several years, developing the underlying mathematical theories and computational tools necessary to assess gerrymandering of legislative maps. Members of these groups have also testified as expert witnesses in suits brought against legislative maps. Furthermore, they've supported non-partisan map drawers attempting to rectify maps deemed unconstitutional, and in one instance even produced an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019); which supporting the application of these methods for assessing legislative maps on the basis of partisan or racial bias. However, 2021 is the first redistricting cycle in which maps are being drawn while these ensemble-based analysis tools are publicly available. This means that the current redistricting cycle is a novel opportunity for map drawing commissions, consultant groups, and advocacy organizations to apply these tools to produce fairer maps or to evaluate and challenge potentially gerrymandered legislative maps as they are developed.
